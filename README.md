# About Me

Hey there! I'm Rabia, an emerging developer with a strong curiosity for building meaningful and efficient solutions. Currently diving deep into AI and automation, I enjoy turning abstract ideas into practical tools that make life (and work!) smarter.

🔧 I’m learning to think like a builder, exploring everything from no-code workflows to full-on coding solutions. Whether it’s designing a mini app, solving a tricky bug, or experimenting with new tech stacks, I enjoy the process of **figuring things out**.
